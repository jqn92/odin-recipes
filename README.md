# Foundations Course
## Project - Recipes
In this project, I am going to build a basic recipe website. No CSS will be added for style at this time; I will only be dealing with the basic structure.
<br>
The website will consist of a **main index page** (*index.html*) which will have links to a few **recipe pages** (*cupcakes.html*, *tomatoes.html*, *mushrooms.html* and *chicken.html*). 
<br>
<br>
### Main index page
The **main index page** will have a *heading* for the title and the *links* will be arranged in an *unordered list*.
<br>
### Recipe pages
Each **recipe page** will have a *heading*, an *image* of the finished dish, a "Description" *heading* followed by one or two *paragraphs* describing the recipe. Under the description, an "Ingredients" *heading* will be added, followed by an *unordered list* of the ingredients needed for the recipe. Lastly, under the list, there should be a "Steps" *heading*, followed by an *ordered list* of the steps needed for making the dish.
